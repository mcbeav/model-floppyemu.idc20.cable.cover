# FloppyEMU IDC20 Cable Cover

Simple model to cover the IDC20 / DB19 adapter for the FloppyEMU. 

This project was inspired by [https://github.com/ThorstenBr/FloppyEmuDiskIIEnclosure](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/FloppyEmuDiskIIEnclosure). I saw the cable cover, and wanted to make a designed that suited my tastes.

*I used magnets 5mm in diameter & 2mm tall to keep the cover together*
